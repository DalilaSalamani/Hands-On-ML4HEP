# Hands-On-ML4HEP

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for Machine learning (ML) for High Energy Physics (HEP) tutorial for beginners. 

### Part 1

Initiation to python with numpy matplolib & uproot and also how to play with file structures (CSV and HDF5).

### Part 2

This part is dedicated to test different classifiers such as Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Random forest using the ML library scikit-learn. The data is represented as dataframes using pandas.  

### Part 3

This part shows how to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for event classification in the calorimeter. The training and test files are a collection of 50.000 showers per particle type. They were constrcuted from the dataset [@ “B.Nachman; L.de Oliveira,; M.Paganini (2017), “Electromagnetic Calorimeter Shower Images”, Mendeley Data, v1“, DOI: 10.17632/pvn3xc3wy5.1"](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pvn3xc3wy5/1).
